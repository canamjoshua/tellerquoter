### 1.2 Key Deliverables

1. **Teller Order Form** (Client-facing)
   - Combined SaaS + Setup Package pricing
   - For client signature

2. **Teller Implementation Plan / Exhibit C** (Client-facing)
   - Selected SKUs with scope descriptions
   - Deliverables per SKU
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Payment milestones (two styles supported)
   - Hardware options
   - Assumptions
   - Warranty terms

3. **Internal Quote Detail Document** (Internal)
   - All rates used
   - Parameters/inputs provided
   - Line-by-line detail including:
     - Escalation rates per line item
     - Discount impact per line
     - Referral fee impact (if applicable)
   - Supports Finance for billing/invoicing
   - Supports Quickbooks categorization
   - Supports Implementation team understanding of scope

4. **Quote Calculator/System**
   - Tool for building quotes
   - Generates all documents above

### 1.3 Quote Management

- Save/load quotes for review and editing
- Organize quotes by client/prospect name
- Search functionality to find quotes
- Auto-assigned quote number for tracking (e.g., Q-2025-0001)

### 1.4 Discounts

- **Types:** Percentage-based (primary) AND fixed dollar amount
- **Can apply to:**
  - SaaS First Year only
  - SaaS throughout (all years)
  - Setup Packages (Services)
  - Any combination of the above
- **Visibility:** Internal document shows impact per line item and on margins

### 1.5 Referral Fees

- Percentage of first year SaaS (typically 5% or 10%)
- Varies by referrer
- System stores referrer information (name, standard rate) for selection
- Shown on internal document / reseller communication only
- NOT shown on client-facing documents

### 1.6 Contract Document Hierarchy

The quoting system generates documents that fit into the existing Can/Am contract structure:

| Document | Purpose | Generated By System? |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **Teller Order Form** | Master ordering document with SaaS + Setup Packages + Variable items | Yes |
| **Exhibit A** | Ad Hoc Professional Services hourly rate ($230/hr for post-go-live work) | Eliminated - content moved to Order Form |
| **Exhibit B** | SaaS Service Descriptions + Hardware Catalog | Template (static boilerplate) |
| **Exhibit C** | Teller Implementation Plan - Selected SKUs, deliverables, acceptance criteria, milestones | Yes |

### 1.7 System Evolution

The quoting system evolves from the existing **Pricing Investment Template V11.xlsx** spreadsheet:

- **Current state:** Excel-based pricing calculator with manual document creation
- **Target state:** Web-based quoting system with automated document generation
- **Migration:** Pricing logic, tier structures, and formulas extracted from V11.xlsx and built into new system
- **Output format:** Word documents (.docx) matching current templates

### 1.8 Configurability Principle

**IMPORTANT:** All prices, amounts, formulas, tier thresholds, and calculation logic specified in this document are **examples only**. The system must allow Admin users to configure all of these values through the Admin UI without code changes.

This includes but is not limited to:
- SKU prices and estimated hours
- SaaS product base prices
- Volume tier thresholds and prices
- Travel zone definitions and costs
- Per diem rates
- Escalation percentages
- Default percentages (initial payment, etc.)
- Population thresholds for Organization Setup tier suggestions
- Complexity thresholds for travel suggestions
- All text snippets (assumptions, warranty, etc.)

The numbers in this document represent the **initial configuration** based on current business rules. Business rules change; the system must accommodate this without developer intervention.

### 1.9 Quote & Pricing Versioning

#### 1.9.1 Quote Iterations

Quotes frequently go through multiple iterations during RFP response and contract negotiation. The system must support:

- **Quote Versioning:** Each quote can have multiple versions (v1, v2, v3...)
- **Version History:** All versions are preserved and accessible
- **Version Comparison:** Ability to see what changed between versions
- **Version Branching:** Create a new version from any previous version (not just the latest)
- **Version Naming:** Auto-increment (v1, v2, v3) plus optional user-provided description (e.g., "v2 - Removed 2 integrations per client request")

#### 1.9.2 Pricing Versions

Pricing configurations (SKU prices, SaaS tiers, formulas) must be versioned:

- **Pricing Version ID:** Each set of pricing rules has a unique version identifier
- **Effective Date:** When this pricing version became active
- **Expiration Date:** Optional; when this pricing version expires (null = no expiration)
- **Version Description:** Admin-provided description of changes (e.g., "2026 Q1 price increase")
- **Immutability:** Once a pricing version is used by any quote, it cannot be modified (only superseded by a new version)

#### 1.9.3 Quote-to-Pricing Linkage

Each quote version is permanently linked to a specific pricing version:

- **Initial Quote:** Uses the current active pricing version at time of creation
- **Quote Revision:** By default, continues using the same pricing version as the previous quote version
- **Pricing Override:** User can explicitly choose to upgrade a quote revision to a newer pricing version (with warning)
- **Expired Pricing Warning:** If the linked pricing version has expired, system warns user but still allows quote revision using original pricing (common for RFP responses where pricing is locked)
- **Forced Upgrade:** Admin can configure whether expired pricing blocks quote revision or just warns

#### 1.9.4 Pricing Version Contents

A pricing version includes all configurable values:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| SKU Pricing | All SKU prices, hours, Quickbooks categories (22 SKUs in V4) |
| SaaS Pricing | Base prices, tier thresholds, tier prices |
| Travel | Zone definitions, airfare by zone, per diem defaults |
| Calculations | Hourly rate, escalation percentages, default initial payment % |
| Thresholds | Population tiers, complexity thresholds |

#### 1.9.5 Audit Trail

All changes to pricing versions must be logged:

- Who created/modified
- When
- What changed (before/after values)
- Why (optional admin-provided reason)

---

## 2. SKU Data Model Requirements

The system must maintain a database of Setup Package SKUs plus SaaS products, each with multiple attributes for pricing, document generation, and quoting logic.

### 2.1 Setup Package SKU Categories

**Note:** Internal SKU Reference Key V4 (December 2025) provides detailed descriptions, hours, and acceptance criteria. Items marked ⚠️ are "Earmarked for Refinement" - pricing subject to change.

---

## 3. Quote Configuration Workflow

**CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE:** The quoting system is **parameter-driven**, not SKU-selection-driven. Users enter client requirements and configuration options; the system automatically determines which SKUs to include and calculates pricing. Users should NOT manually pick SKUs from a list.

### 3.1 Configuration Flow Overview

The quote configuration follows this sequence:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ STEP 1: Organization & Project Parameters                           │
│   → Determines: Organization Setup SKU, PM months, Travel zones     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ STEP 2: Application Modules (checkboxes with sub-parameters)        │
│   → Determines: Module SKUs, SaaS line items                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ STEP 3: Integrations (add/configure each)                           │
│   → Determines: Integration SKUs (Mature vs Custom vs Credit)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ STEP 4: Online Forms (if applicable)                                │
│   → Determines: Online Forms SKUs by tier + workflow add-ons        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ STEP 5: Training (auto-calculated with optional adjustments)        │
│   → Determines: Training Suite + add-ons                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ STEP 6: Travel Configuration                                        │
│   → Determines: Travel costs (Variable section)                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ STEP 7: Discounts & Adjustments                                     │
│   → Applies: SaaS and/or Services discounts                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ STEP 8: Review & Generate                                           │
│   → Shows: Complete SKU list with prices, generates documents       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3.2 Step 1: Organization & Project Parameters

#### 3.2.1 Required Parameters

| Parameter | Input Type | Options/Range | Maps To |
|-----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| Client/Prospect Name | Text | Free text | Quote header, documents |
| Deal Type | Select | New Client, Expansion | Affects available SKUs |
| Teller Edition | Select | Standard, Basic | SaaS base pricing |
| User Type | Select | Named, Concurrent | SaaS user pricing |
| Additional Users | Number | 0-999 | SaaS user line items |
| Number of Departments | Number | 1-99 | Organization Setup SKU selection |
| Project Duration | Number | 1-24 months | PM SKU quantity |
| Project Complexity | Select | Standard, Enterprise | PM SKU type |
| Travel Zone | Select | 1 (Local), 2, 3, 4 (Remote) | Travel cost rates |
| 24/7 Support Required | Checkbox | Yes/No | SaaS add-on (if applicable) |

#### 3.2.2 Organization Setup SKU Auto-Selection Logic

Based on the parameters entered, the system automatically selects the appropriate Organization Setup SKU:

```
IF Number of Departments = 1:
    SELECT "Basic Teller Setup" ($23,920)
ELSE IF Number of Departments > 1:
    SELECT "Enterprise Setup - Medium" ($23,920)  // Default for multi-dept
    // Note: Large tier differentiation criteria TBD (see Open Items)

    THEN FOR each department beyond the first:
        ADD "Additional Department Setup" ($3,680)
```

**Future Enhancement:** When Organization Setup tiering criteria are finalized (population-based or complexity-based), add prompts to collect those parameters and adjust SKU selection accordingly.

#### 3.2.3 Project Management Auto-Selection Logic

```
PM_MONTHS = Project Duration value

IF Project Complexity = "Standard":
    ADD PM_MONTHS × "PM Month - Standard" ($2,300/mo)
ELSE IF Project Complexity = "Enterprise":
    ADD PM_MONTHS × "PM Month - Enterprise" ($6,900/mo)
```

### 3.3 Step 2: Application Modules

Application modules are presented as **checkboxes**. When a checkbox is enabled, relevant **sub-parameters** appear for that module.

#### 3.3.1 Application Module Checkboxes

| Module Checkbox | When Enabled, Show Sub-Parameters | SKUs Added |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| ☐ Check Recognition & Bulk Scanning | Estimated monthly scans | Check Recognition & ICL Setup + SaaS |
| ☐ Image Cash Letter (ICL) | Bank name (for assumptions) | (bundled with Check Recognition) |
| ☐ Revenue Submission | Number of templates, Workflow needed? | Revenue Submission SKUs + SaaS |
| ☐ Workflow Submission | Number of workflows | Workflow Submission Setup + SaaS |
| ☐ Teller Online (Customer Portal) | Est. annual transactions, Integration count | Teller Online SKUs + SaaS |

**SKU Logic:**
```
IF Check Recognition enabled:
    ADD "Check Recognition & ICL Setup" ($3,680)
    ADD SaaS line item based on scan volume tier
```

#### 3.3.3 Revenue Submission Sub-Parameters

When "Revenue Submission" is checked:

| Sub-Parameter | Input Type | Purpose |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Number of Templates | Number | Base (≤10) vs Template Blocks |
| Number of Submitters | Number | SaaS tier calculation |
| Include Workflow Capability | Checkbox | Adds Workflow Submission SKU |

**SKU Logic:**
```
IF Revenue Submission enabled:
    ADD "Revenue Submission Setup - Base" ($5,520)  // Includes first 10 templates

    IF Number of Templates > 10:
        TEMPLATE_BLOCKS = CEILING((Number of Templates - 10) / 10)
        ADD TEMPLATE_BLOCKS × "Revenue Submission - Template Block" ($2,760)

    IF Include Workflow Capability:
        ADD "Workflow Submission Setup" (TBD)

    ADD SaaS line item based on submitter tier
```

#### 3.3.4 Teller Online Sub-Parameters

When "Teller Online (Customer Portal)" is checked:

| Sub-Parameter | Input Type | Purpose |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Estimated Annual Transactions | Number | SaaS tier calculation |
| Number of System Integrations | Number | Integration add-on SKUs |

**For each integration**, prompt for:

| Integration Sub-Parameter | Input Type | Options |
|---------------------------|------------|---------|
| System Name | Text/Select | Name or select from known systems |
| Integration Maturity | Select | Mature (existing connector), New (development needed) |

**SKU Logic:**
```
IF Teller Online enabled:
    ADD "Teller Online Setup" ($9,200)
    ADD SaaS line item based on transaction tier

    FOR EACH System Integration:
        IF Maturity = "Mature":
            ADD "Teller Online - Integration Add-on (Mature)" ($2,760)
        ELSE IF Maturity = "New":
            ADD "Teller Online - Integration Add-on (New)" ($6,440)
```

#### 3.3.5 Online Forms Sub-Parameters

**SKU Logic:**
```
IF Online Forms enabled:
    ADD Simple_Count × "Online Forms - Tier 1" ($4,600)
    ADD Medium_Count × "Online Forms - Tier 2" ($9,200)
    ADD Complex_Count × "Online Forms - Tier 3" ($13,800)

    FOR EACH form with Workflow enabled:
        ADD "Online Forms - Workflow Add-on" ($11,500)

    ADD SaaS line item based on total form count
```

### 3.4 Step 3: Integrations

Integrations are configured by **adding entries** to an integration list, not by selecting from SKUs.

#### 3.4.1 Integration Entry Interface

User clicks "Add Integration" and provides:

| Field | Input Type | Options |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Integration Type | Select | Bi-Directional, Payment Import, Credit Processing |
| System Name | Text/Autocomplete | Free text or select from known systems |
| For Teller Online? | Checkbox | Only if Teller Online is enabled |

**Conditional fields based on Integration Type:**

**If Bi-Directional:**
| Field | Input Type | Options |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Maturity | Select | Mature (on approved list), Custom Development (new/immature) |

**If Credit Processing:**
| Field | Input Type | Options |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Processor Status | Select | Existing (CORE, Paymentus, etc.), New Processor |

**If Payment Import:**
- No additional sub-parameters (standard pricing regardless of system)

#### 3.4.2 Integration SKU Auto-Selection Logic

```
FOR EACH Integration entry:

    IF Type = "Bi-Directional":
        IF Maturity = "Mature":
            ADD "Integration - Configuration" ($7,360)
        ELSE:
            ADD "Integration - Custom Development" ($28,520)

    ELSE IF Type = "Payment Import":
        ADD "Integration - Payment Import" ($5,520)

    ELSE IF Type = "Credit Processing":
        IF Processor Status = "Existing":
            ADD "Credit Integration - Existing" ($9,200)
        ELSE:
            ADD "Credit Integration - New" ($28,520)
```

#### 3.4.3 Third-Party Redirect (Special Case)

If an external portal needs to redirect to Teller Online for payment:

| Field | Input Type | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Third-Party Redirect Required | Checkbox | Adds Third-Party Redirect SKU |
| External System Name | Text | For documentation |

```
IF Third-Party Redirect Required:
    ADD "Teller Online - Third-Party Redirect" ($28,520)
```

#### 3.4.4 Mature Integrations List

The system maintains a list of "Mature" integrations. When user enters a system name:
- If it matches a known mature integration → Auto-select "Mature"
- If not recognized → Default to "Custom Development" with option to override

**Note:** Mature Integrations List is maintained in Admin settings (see Section 2.2.1).

### 3.5 Step 4: Online Forms Detail

If Online Forms was enabled in Step 2, this step allows detailed configuration of each form.

**Simplified Mode (default):**
- Enter counts by tier (Simple, Medium, Complex)
- Specify how many forms need workflow

**Detailed Mode (optional):**
- Add each form individually with name, tier, and workflow flag
- Useful for documenting specific forms in Implementation Plan

### 3.6 Step 5: Training Auto-Calculation

Training SKUs are **automatically determined** based on the quote configuration. Users can adjust but shouldn't need to manually select training SKUs.

#### 3.6.1 Training Auto-Selection Logic

```
// Teller Training Suite is always included for new implementations
IF Deal Type = "New Client":
    ADD "Teller Training Suite" ($12,880)

// Revenue Submission Training if Revenue Submission is enabled
IF Revenue Submission enabled:
    ADD "Revenue Submission Training Add-on" ($1,840)

// End-User Cashiering is optional (user specifies count)
IF End-User Sessions Requested > 0:
    ADD End_User_Sessions × "End-User Cashiering Training" ($920)
```

#### 3.6.2 Training Adjustments

User can:
- Add additional End-User Cashiering sessions
- Remove Training Suite (rare - expansion quotes where training already done)
- Override if special circumstances

### 3.7 Step 6: Travel Configuration

Travel is configured by specifying **trips**, not by selecting SKUs.

#### 3.7.1 Standard Trip Types

| Trip Type | Default Days | Default Staff | Typical Projects |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| Project Kickoff | 2 | 2 | All projects |
| Integration Analysis | 2 | 1 | Projects with integrations |
| Training Delivery | 2 | 2 | All new client projects |
| Go-Live Support | 2 | 1 | All projects |

#### 3.7.2 Trip Configuration Interface

For each trip:
| Field | Input Type | Default |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Trip Type | Select | (from list above) |
| Number of Days | Number | Per trip type default |
| Number of Staff | Number | Per trip type default |
| Trip Count | Number | 1 |

#### 3.7.3 Travel Cost Calculation

```
FOR EACH trip:
    Travel_Time_Cost = Days × Staff × 8 hours × $230/hr
    Travel_Expense_Cost = Days × Staff × Zone_Per_Diem_Rate

    Trip_Total = Travel_Time_Cost + Travel_Expense_Cost

TOTAL_TRAVEL = SUM(all Trip_Totals)
```

### 3.8 Step 7: Discounts & Adjustments

#### 3.8.1 Discount Configuration

| Field | Input Type | Options |
|-------|------------|---------|
| SaaS Discount Type | Select | None, Percentage, Fixed Amount |
| SaaS Discount Value | Number | % or $ |
| SaaS Discount Scope | Select | First Year Only, All Years |
| Services Discount Type | Select | None, Percentage, Fixed Amount |
| Services Discount Value | Number | % or $ |

#### 3.8.2 Referrer Configuration

| Field | Input Type | Options |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Referrer | Select/Search | From saved referrers list, or "None" |
| Referral Fee | Auto-populated | Based on selected referrer's rate |

### 3.9 Step 8: Review & Generate

After configuration is complete, the system displays:

1. **Configuration Summary** - All parameters entered
2. **Auto-Generated SKU List** - SKUs determined by the configuration with quantities and prices
3. **SaaS Summary** - Monthly and annual SaaS costs
4. **Setup Package Total** - Sum of all SKUs
5. **Travel Estimate** - Based on configured trips
6. **Discounts Applied** - Impact on totals
7. **Grand Total** - Combined SaaS + Setup + Travel

User can:
- Go back to any step to adjust parameters
- Override individual SKU selections (with warning)
- Add notes/comments
- Generate documents

### 3.10 SKU Override Capability

While the system auto-selects SKUs based on parameters, users CAN manually adjust:

| Override Type | Example Use Case | System Behavior |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Add SKU not auto-selected | Special circumstance | Allow with note field for justification |
| Remove auto-selected SKU | Client already has training | Allow with warning |
| Change SKU quantity | Need extra form at different tier | Allow |
| Change SKU to different tier | Medium form actually complex | Allow |

**Override Warning:** When user overrides auto-selection, system displays: "This SKU was auto-selected based on your configuration. Override? [Keep Auto / Override]"

### 3.11 Expansion Quote Mode

For existing clients adding modules (Deal Type = "Expansion"):

- Organization Setup SKUs are **not** auto-added
- Training Suite is **not** auto-added (unless requested)
- PM months may be shorter
- User explicitly selects which new modules/integrations to add

### 3.12 Configuration Parameters Summary

## 4. SaaS Pricing Calculation Requirements

The system must calculate SaaS pricing based on volume tiers and product selections.

### 4.1 Base SaaS Products

| Product | Monthly Price | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Teller Standard | $2,950 | Includes 5 named users, multi-department |
| Teller Basic | $995 | Includes 5 named users, single department (salesperson discretion) |
| Additional Named User | $60 | Per user beyond 5 |
| Bi-Directional Interface | $285 | Per real-time interface |
| Payment Import Interface | $170 | Per import interface |

### 4.2 Volume-Tiered Pricing

#### Check Recognition / Bulk Scanning

| Annual Scans | Monthly Price | Price per Scan |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| 0 - 15,000 | $170 | $0.0113 |
| 15,001 - 30,000 | $340 | $0.0113 |
| 30,001 - 60,000 | $680 | $0.0113 |
| 60,001 - 100,000 | $1,030 | $0.0103 |
| 100,001 - 150,000 | $1,350 | $0.009 |
| 150,001 - 200,000 | $1,600 | $0.008 |
| 200,001+ | $3,500+ | $0.007 |

#### Image Cash Letter

- Calculated as **65% of Check Recognition price**
- Minimum: $170/month

#### Revenue Submission (includes Workflow Submission)

Revenue Submission and Workflow Submission are the same module. Base pricing covers standard submission; enhanced workflow capability is an additional tier.

| Templates/Departments | Monthly Price | Notes |
|-----------------------|---------------|-------|
| 0 - 9 | $450 | Base |
| 10 - 24 | $570 | Base |
| 25 - 60 | $700 | Base |
| 60+ | $900 | Base |

#### Revenue Submission - Enhanced Workflow Add-on

| Workflows | Monthly Price |
|-----------|---------------|
| 0 - 2 | $750 |
| 3 - 4 | $850 |
| 5 - 9 | $1,000 |
| 10 - 19 | $5,000 |
| 20+ | $10,000 |

#### Online Customer Portal

| Annual Transactions | Monthly Price | Cost per Transaction |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 0 - 50,000 | $700 | $0.1716 |
| 50,001 - 100,000 | $1,430 | $0.1716 |
| 100,001 - 150,000 | $2,145 | $0.1716 |
| 150,001 - 200,000 | $2,860 | $0.1716 |
| 200,001 - 250,000 | $3,575 | $0.1716 |
| 250,001 - 300,000 | $4,290 | $0.1716 |
| 300,001 - 400,000 | $5,339 | ~$0.160 |
| 400,001 - 500,000 | $6,673 | ~$0.160 |
| 500,001 - 600,000 | $7,436 | ~$0.149 |
| 600,001 - 700,000 | $8,675 | ~$0.149 |

|------------|---------------|
| 1 | $50 |
| 2 | $100 |
| 5 | $200 |
| 10 | $300 |
| 15 | $400 |
| 25 | $500 |

### 4.3 Teller Payments

- **Not a SaaS cost** - No additional monthly fee
- **Enables 10% discount** off total SaaS cost when included
- **Assumption:** Teller Payments is used for all payment processing for Teller
- Shown as optional selection in quote builder

### 4.4 Annual Inflation / Escalation

Three escalation models are supported:

| Model | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Standard 4%** | 4% annual increase from Year 2 onwards | Default for most deals |
| **CPI-Based** | Tied to Consumer Price Index, minimum 0% | RFP requirements for CPI |
| **Multi-Year Freeze** | No escalation for Years 1-N, then 4% annually | Government/RFP with rate protection |

### 4.5 Multi-Year Projections

- **Projection period:** User selects (default: 5 years)
- System calculates year-by-year costs with escalation
- System calculates total over projection period

### 4.6 Level Loading Option

For clients requiring constant (non-escalated) annual costs:

- **Calculation:** Total escalated cost over projection period ÷ number of years = constant annual amount
- **Effect:** Each year's SaaS cost is the same flat amount
- **Revenue neutral:** Can/Am receives the same total revenue over the period
- **Display:** Level loading adjustment applied to Teller Standard/Basic line item in Order Form

**Example (5-year projection):**

| Year | Standard Escalated | Level Loaded |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1 | $35,400 | $38,254 |
| 2 | $36,816 | $38,254 |
| 3 | $38,289 | $38,254 |
| 4 | $39,820 | $38,254 |
| 5 | $41,413 | $38,254 |
| **Total** | **$191,738** | **$191,270** |

---

## 5. Travel Cost Calculation Requirements

Travel costs are calculated separately and shown in the Variable section of the Order Form.

### 5.1 Travel Zones

All zone and airfare values are configurable via Admin UI.

| Zone | Region | Airfare Estimate |
|------|--------|------------------|
| 0 | Denver Metro Colorado | $0 |
| 1 | Western US | $750 |
| 2 | Mid-Western US | $850 |
| 3 | Eastern US | $950 |
| 4 | Outside Continental US | $1,050 |
| 5 | Canada | $950 |

### 5.2 Travel Cost Components

Travel costs consist of four components. Per diem (meals) should be looked up against **GSA rates** for the client's location when available.

| Component | Default Rate | Basis | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|-------|
| Airfare | Per zone table above | Per person per trip | Varies by zone |
| Hotel | $180 | Per person per night | GSA lookup preferred |
| Per Diem (Meals) | $60 | Per person per day | GSA lookup preferred |
| Vehicle | $125 | Per day (shared) | Rental car or mileage, same for all zones |

**Notes:**
- Airfare is the only component that varies by zone
- Vehicle cost is per day for the trip (shared among travelers), not per person
- Hotel nights = trip days + 1 (arrive evening before, leave morning after)
- For Denver Metro zone, airfare is $0 but other costs still apply

**GSA Integration:** System should support lookup of GSA per diem rates by client city/state. If GSA lookup unavailable or not configured, use default rates.

### 5.3 Standard Trip Types

| Trip Type | Days | People | Typical Phase |
|-----------|------|--------|---------------|
| Kickoff & Analysis | 2 | 2 | Month 1 |
| Interface Integration | 2 | 1 | Month 2 |
| Training | 2 | 2 | Month 9 |
| Go-Live Support | 2 | 1 | Month 10 |

### 5.4 Complexity-Driven Trip Defaults

The system should suggest default trip configurations based on project complexity.

**Complexity Factor:** Derived from total annual SaaS value (which reflects overall implementation complexity including integrations, departments, modules, etc.)

| Complexity Level | Total Annual SaaS | Default Trips |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Low | < $50,000 | Kickoff only (or remote) |
| Medium | $50,000 - $100,000 | Kickoff + Go-Live |
| High | $100,000 - $150,000 | Kickoff + Training + Go-Live |
| Very High | > $150,000 | All 4 trip types |

*Note: These are suggestions only. Sales can override trip selections.*

### 5.5 Travel Cost Formula

```
Trip Nights = Days + 1 (arrive evening before, leave morning after)
Trip Cost = (Airfare × People) + (Hotel × People × Trip Nights) + (Per Diem × People × Trip Nights) + (Vehicle × Trip Nights)
Total Travel = Sum of all trip costs
```

**Example: 2-day trip with 2 people to Zone 1 (Western US)**
- Trip Nights: 2 + 1 = 3
- Airfare: $750 × 2 = $1,500
- Hotel: $180 × 2 people × 3 nights = $1,080
- Per Diem: $60 × 2 people × 3 nights = $360
- Vehicle: $125 × 3 nights = $375
- **Trip Total: $3,315**

### 5.6 Travel Time

- Travel TIME (labor hours) is built into SKU pricing
- Travel COSTS (expenses) are billed separately at estimated/actual cost

---

## 6. Implementation Plan Requirements

### 6.1 Payment Milestone Styles

The system supports two payment milestone styles:

#### Style A: Fixed Monthly

Simple, predictable payment schedule.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| InitialPaymentPercentage | Percentage due at contract execution | 25% |
| ProjectDurationMonths | Number of months for remaining payments | From quote |

**Calculation:**
- Initial Payment = Total Setup Packages × InitialPaymentPercentage
- Monthly Payment = (Total Setup Packages - Initial Payment) ÷ (ProjectDurationMonths - 1)
- PM services included in monthly amount

**Example (10-month project, $100,000, 25% initial):**
- Contract Execution: $25,000 (25%)
- Months 2-10: $8,333.33 each (9 payments)
- Total: $100,000

#### Style B: Deliverable-Based

Payments tied to specific deliverable acceptance points.

**Components:**
1. Initial payment at contract execution (percentage of total)
2. Monthly services fee (PM + prorated deliverables)
3. Major deliverable payments tied to SKU completion

**Monthly Services Calculation:**
- PM SKU total ÷ ProjectDurationMonths = Monthly PM portion
- 50% of other SKUs ÷ ProjectDurationMonths = Prorated deliverable portion
- Monthly Services = PM portion + Prorated portion

**Deliverable Payments:**
- Remaining 50% of non-PM SKUs paid at acceptance milestones
- Each SKU has DeliveryMilestones with TypicalMonth and PercentageOfSKU

**Example (10-month project, $186,750 total, 15% initial):**
- Contract Execution: $28,013 (15%)
- Monthly Services (×10): $6,000 each
- Enterprise Setup Complete (Month 2): $10,250
- Integration Requirements (Month 3): $25,750
- Integration Development (Month 6): $34,500
- Modules Complete (Month 7): $18,500
- Training Complete (Month 9): $14,000
- Go-Live (Month 10): $16,000

### 6.2 Implementation Plan Sections

| Section | Content | Dynamic/Configurable |
|---------|---------|---------------------|

Client acknowledges that CanAm's performance of this Agreement is dependent in part on Client's actions and that any dates or time periods relevant to the performance of this Agreement by CanAm will be appropriately extended to account for any delays caused by Client's actions or omissions or failure to perform any of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement.
>
> **CanAm warrants the Services provided under this Agreement for a period of ninety (90) days after Go-Live.**

### 6.6 Regeneration Support

The system must support regenerating the Implementation Plan during contract negotiation when:
- Milestone style changes (Fixed Monthly ↔ Deliverable-Based)
- Initial payment percentage changes
- Project duration changes
- SKUs added or removed

## 11. Open Items & Decisions Needed

### 11.1 Pending Decisions

1. **Organization Setup Tiering Criteria** - Internal Key V4 shows all org setup tiers at 104 hours/$23,920. If differentiation is needed, what criteria should be used (was population-based)?

2. **Workflow Submission Pricing** - Internal Key V4 lists as TBD. Need Noah's input on hours and pricing.

3. **Report Writing Training** - Was separate SKU in V2 ($5,520); appears to be rolled into Teller Training Suite per Internal Key V4 description. Confirm.

4. **Equipment Integration** - Confirm: hardware catalog in Exhibit B (static), pricing in Order Form + Implementation Plan

5. **SKU Delivery Milestones** - Need Noah's input on delivery points per SKU for deliverable-based milestone calculation

### 11.2 Items Earmarked for Refinement ⚠️

The following SKUs are marked "Earmarked for Refinement" in Internal Key V4 - pricing may change:

| SKU | Current Price | Notes |

## Appendix A: Design Decisions & Rationale

This appendix documents key decisions and the reasoning behind them, to help future developers/maintainers understand the "why" behind the system design.

### A.1 Why Productized SKUs Instead of Custom SOWs

**Decision:** Transform professional services into standardized Setup Package SKUs with fixed pricing.

**Rationale:**
- **Reseller friction:** Custom SOWs required extensive back-and-forth with resellers to define scope, leading to delays and disputes
- **Quoting speed:** Custom scoping took hours/days; target is 15 minutes with SKU selection
- **Scalability:** Can/Am cannot scale beyond current team if every deal requires custom scoping
- **Scope creep prevention:** Fixed SKU boundaries make it clear what's included vs. out-of-scope
- **Quality consistency:** Same SKU = same delivery process = predictable outcomes
- **Future certification:** Enables training third parties to deliver standardized packages

**Source:** Impact Filter document (project vision statement)

### A.2 Why Two Payment Milestone Styles

**Decision:** Support both Fixed Monthly and Deliverable-Based milestone schedules.

**Rationale:**
- **Fixed Monthly:** Some clients (especially government) need predictable monthly budget allocations; simpler for Finance to manage
- **Deliverable-Based:** Other clients prefer paying tied to acceptance of specific deliverables; provides accountability checkpoints
- **Negotiation flexibility:** Can switch styles during contract negotiation without re-quoting
- **Historical precedent:** Fond du Lac SOW used deliverable-based; other clients have requested fixed monthly

**Trade-off:** Deliverable-Based requires more complex calculation and SKU-level milestone data; Fixed Monthly is simpler but less granular.

### A.3 Why Integration Pricing Has 3.9x Difference (Configuration vs Custom)

**Decision:** Integration - Configuration ($7,360) vs Integration - Custom Development ($28,520)

**Rationale:**
- **Actual effort difference:** Configuration uses pre-built connectors (32 hrs); Custom requires new development (124 hrs)
- **Risk profile:** Custom development has higher uncertainty and testing requirements
- **Mature Integrations List:** Critical for accurate quoting - sales MUST verify if an integration is "mature" (2-3+ clients already using) before quoting Configuration price
- **Mis-quoting impact:** Quoting Configuration for what should be Custom = $21,160 revenue loss and delivery problems

**Implication for system:** Must enforce selection from Mature Integrations List when Configuration SKU is chosen; warn if integration not on list.

### A.4 Why Travel Costs Are Separate from SKU Pricing

**Decision:** Travel TIME (labor) is built into SKUs; Travel COSTS (expenses) are calculated separately and shown in Variable section.

**Rationale:**
- **Geographic variability:** Airfare, hotels, per diem vary significantly by client location
- **GSA compliance:** Government clients often require GSA rate adherence
- **Transparency:** Clients can see travel as a distinct line item
- **Actual cost billing:** Travel is billed at actual cost, not estimated; showing estimate sets expectations
- **Denver Metro exception:** Can/Am is based in Colorado; no airfare needed for local clients

**Zone system rationale:** Simplified into 6 zones to make quoting fast while maintaining reasonable accuracy.

### A.5 Why Exhibit A Was Eliminated

**Decision:** Move Ad Hoc Professional Services hourly rate from Exhibit A into Order Form body.

**Rationale:**
- **Document simplification:** Fewer exhibits = simpler contract structure
- **Exhibit A was minimal:** Only contained one item (hourly rate) - didn't warrant separate exhibit
- **Exhibit B retained:** SaaS Service Descriptions are substantial and static (boilerplate)
- **Exhibit C retained:** Implementation Plan is dynamic and deal-specific

### A.6 Why Internal Quote Detail Document Exists

**Decision:** Generate a separate internal-only document with full pricing detail.

**Rationale:**
- **Finance needs:** Billing/invoicing requires line-by-line detail not appropriate for client documents
- **Quickbooks integration:** Category codes needed for proper accounting
- **Referral fee visibility:** Reseller fees shown internally, never on client documents
- **Discount transparency:** Impact of discounts on margins visible to sales management
- **Implementation handoff:** Delivery team needs to understand what was sold (hours, scope per SKU)

### A.7 Why Pricing Versioning Is Required

**Decision:** All pricing configurations are versioned; quotes are linked to specific pricing versions.

**Rationale:**
- **RFP integrity:** During RFP responses, pricing is often "locked" - revisions to a quote must use original pricing even if Can/Am's standard pricing has changed
- **Audit trail:** Finance and management need to understand what pricing was in effect when a quote was created
- **Immutability:** Once pricing is used in a quote, it cannot be changed (only superseded by new version)
- **Reproduction:** Must be able to regenerate documents with exact pricing from any point in time

**Trade-off:** More complex data model, but essential for business integrity.

### A.8 Why Quote Versioning Is Required

**Decision:** Quotes support multiple versions (v1, v2, v3...) with full history preserved.

**Rationale:**
- **Negotiation reality:** Quotes go through multiple iterations during client discussions
- **Change tracking:** Sales and management need to see what changed between versions
- **Rollback capability:** Sometimes need to revert to a previous version
- **Audit compliance:** Some contracts require showing negotiation history

### A.9 Why Check Recognition & ICL Are Bundled

**Decision:** Single SKU "Check Recognition & ICL Setup" rather than separate SKUs.

**Rationale:**
- **Mirrors SaaS bundling:** SaaS pricing bundles these together
- **Technical dependency:** ICL requires Check Recognition to function
- **Typical purchase pattern:** Clients buying check scanning almost always need ICL
- **Pricing simplicity:** One SKU to configure vs. two

### A.10 Why Organization Setup Includes Go-Live Support

**Decision:** Go-Live support (2 days) is bundled into Organization Setup SKUs, not a separate SKU.

**Rationale:**
- **Every implementation needs Go-Live:** Never makes sense to skip; bundling ensures it's included
- **Pricing clarity:** Client sees one price for "getting started" rather than multiple line items
- **Tier differentiation:** Single Dept (16 hrs Go-Live), Enterprise Mid (16 hrs), Enterprise Large (24 hrs) - reflects complexity
- **Prevents underselling:** Sales can't accidentally omit Go-Live support

### A.11 Why Level Loading Option Exists

**Decision:** Allow SaaS pricing to be "level loaded" (constant annual amount) instead of escalating.

**Rationale:**
- **Government budgeting:** Many government clients need predictable year-over-year costs for budget planning
- **Revenue neutral:** Can/Am receives same total revenue; just distributed differently
- **RFP requirements:** Some RFPs explicitly require flat pricing over contract term
- **Calculation method:** Sum of escalated costs ÷ years = level loaded annual amount

### A.12 Why Three Escalation Models

**Decision:** Support Standard 4%, CPI-Based, and Multi-Year Freeze escalation options.

**Rationale:**
- **Standard 4%:** Default for most commercial clients; predictable increase
- **CPI-Based:** Some RFPs require CPI-linked pricing; protects both parties from inflation
- **Multi-Year Freeze:** Government RFPs sometimes require rate protection for 3-5 years; compensated by higher initial pricing or accepted as competitive positioning

### A.13 Why Conditional Assumptions

**Decision:** Assumptions section includes both standard (always shown) and conditional (shown based on quote components) assumptions.

**Rationale:**
- **Reduces manual editing:** System automatically includes relevant caveats based on what's quoted
- **Prevents omissions:** Critical assumptions (e.g., "Client provides API specs") not forgotten
- **Document consistency:** Same triggers = same assumptions across all quotes
- **Examples:**
  - Bi-directional integrations → Include API/dev environment assumption
  - Teller Payments → Include CORE merchant agreement assumption
  - ICL → Include bank cooperation assumption

### A.14 Why Training Is Train-the-Trainer (Updated in V4)

**Decision (V2):** Standard training SKUs are Train-the-Trainer format (24 hrs, $5,520 each); End-User sessions are separate (4 hrs, $920).

**Decision (V4):** Training consolidated into Teller Training Suite ($12,880) covering all core functions, plus add-ons for Revenue Submission ($1,840) and End-User sessions ($920).

**Rationale for consolidation (V4):**
- **Simplified quoting:** One Training Suite SKU vs. selecting 4+ individual courses
- **Package value:** Suite at $12,880 vs. 4 courses at $22,080 = $9,200 savings for client
- **Consistent delivery:** All core training delivered together, not à la carte
- **Still scalable:** Train-the-Trainer format retained

**Rationale for Train-the-Trainer (unchanged):**
- **Scalability:** Training 2-3 trainers who then train hundreds of users is more efficient than Can/Am training everyone
- **Client empowerment:** Client staff become self-sufficient for onboarding new employees
- **Cost efficiency:** Lower total cost for client vs. paying for all end-user training
- **Exception available:** End-User Cashiering Training SKU exists for clients who prefer direct training

### A.15 Why 15-Minute Quoting Target

**Decision:** Sales should be able to complete a quote in under 15 minutes.

**Rationale:**
- **Current pain point:** Manual process takes hours, sometimes days for complex quotes
- **Reseller responsiveness:** Resellers need quick turnaround to respond to their clients
- **Volume handling:** As sales grow, can't spend hours per quote
- **Competitive advantage:** Faster quotes = better win rate

**Implication for system:** Minimize clicks, auto-suggest based on SaaS selections, pre-fill defaults, show running totals in real-time.

### A.16 Why Population-Based Organization Setup Tiers

**Decision:** Enterprise Setup tiers based on population (<100K = Mid-tier, 100K+ = Large).

**Rationale:**
- **Proxy for complexity:** Population correlates with number of departments, transaction volume, integration complexity
- **Easy to determine:** Population is publicly available data; doesn't require discovery call
- **Historical validation:** Effort estimates validated against projects of different sizes
- **Not perfect but practical:** Some small cities are complex, some large cities are simple - but population is a reasonable default that sales can override

### A.17 Why All Configuration Must Be Admin-Editable

**Decision:** Every price, formula, threshold, and text snippet must be configurable via Admin UI without code changes.

**Rationale:**
- **Business agility:** Pricing changes shouldn't require developer involvement
- **Reduced risk:** No code deployments for business rule changes
- **Empowerment:** Business owners can respond quickly to market conditions
- **Audit trail:** All changes logged with who/when/why

**Examples of configurable items:**
- SKU prices and hours
- Hourly rate ($230 currently)
- SaaS tier thresholds and prices
- Escalation percentages
- Travel zone costs
- Population thresholds for tier suggestions
- All document text (warranty, assumptions, etc.)

### A.18 Why Credit Integration Is Separate from General Integration (V4)

**Decision:** Create separate Credit Integration SKUs (Existing $9,200, New $28,520) distinct from general Integration SKUs.

**Rationale:**
- **Different expertise:** Credit card processing integration requires specialized knowledge of payment processors, PCI compliance, and tokenization
- **Maturity model differs:** "Existing" = Teller-integrated processors (known working); "New" = new processor development
- **Pricing clarity:** Credit integration pricing visible separately from ERP/utility system integrations
- **Risk differentiation:** New credit processors carry higher risk/effort than mature processors

### A.19 Why Some SKUs Are "Earmarked for Refinement" (V4)

**Decision:** V4 marks certain SKUs with ⚠️ indicating pricing is subject to change.

**Rationale:**
- **Honest uncertainty:** Rather than commit to potentially incorrect prices, Noah flagged items needing more analysis
- **Organization Setup:** Flattening all tiers to $23,920 may not reflect actual effort differences; tiering criteria still TBD
- **New SKUs:** Credit Integration and Workflow Submission are new; need delivery experience to validate pricing
- **Check Recognition & ICL:** Price reduction ($4,600 → $3,680) needs validation against actual project data

**Implication for system:** Support for "provisional" or "draft" pricing status on SKUs; warn sales when quoting earmarked items.

### A.20 Why Teller Online Integration Has Three Tiers (Internal Key V4)

**Decision:** Teller Online integration is now tiered into three SKUs:
- **Mature Add-on** ($2,760, 12 hrs) - Existing connector specifications
- **New Add-on** ($6,440, 28 hrs) - New system integration development
- **Third-Party Redirect** ($28,520, 124 hrs) - External portals redirecting to Teller Online

**Rationale:**
- **Effort differentiation:** Mature connectors require only configuration (12 hrs); new integrations require development (28 hrs); third-party redirects require full custom development (124 hrs)
- **Use case clarity:** Third-Party Redirect is a distinct scenario where external portals (e.g., utility billing system) redirect customers to Teller Online for payment
- **Pricing transparency:** Clients can see the cost difference between leveraging existing connectors vs. building new ones
- **Sales guidance:** Clear criteria for which SKU to select based on integration scenario

### A.21 Why PM "Complex" Was Renamed to "Enterprise" (Internal Key V4)

**Decision:** Renamed "PM Month - Complex" to "PM Month - Enterprise"

**Rationale:**
- **Positive framing:** "Complex" has negative connotations; "Enterprise" suggests premium service for larger clients
- **Client perception:** Enterprise clients expect enhanced service; naming aligns with expectations
- **Consistent naming:** Aligns with "Enterprise Setup - Medium/Large" naming convention

### A.22 Why Parameter-Driven Configuration Instead of SKU Selection (v1.8)

**Decision:** The quoting system is designed as a **parameter-entry workflow**, NOT a manual SKU selection interface. Users enter client requirements and configuration options; the system automatically determines which SKUs to include.

**Rationale:**
- **Reduces errors:** Manual SKU selection requires deep product knowledge; parameter entry is intuitive (e.g., "How many departments?" vs "Which Organization Setup SKU?")
- **Enforces consistency:** Auto-selection applies business rules uniformly (e.g., Training Suite always included for new clients)
- **Preserves SKU relationships:** Dependencies and combinations are handled automatically (e.g., Revenue Submission Workflow requires Base)
- **Mirrors Excel workflow:** Current Pricing Investment Template V11.xlsx uses parameter entry on the Parameters sheet; users are familiar with this approach
- **Supports 15-minute target:** Answering questions is faster than searching through 26 SKUs
- **Enables validation:** System can warn about unusual combinations or missing components
- **Prevents omissions:** Auto-inclusion of common SKUs (Training Suite, PM) prevents accidental exclusion

**Key Parameters from Excel that drive SKU selection:**
- Number of Departments → Organization Setup tier + Additional Departments
- Application checkboxes (Check Recognition, Revenue Submission, etc.) → Module SKUs
- Integration entries with Maturity flag → Integration SKUs (Configuration vs Custom)
- Template counts, form counts → Quantity SKUs
- Project duration and complexity → PM SKU quantity and type

**Override capability:** Users CAN manually adjust the auto-generated SKU list, but this is the exception rather than the primary workflow. Overrides require justification.

**Implication for system:**
- UI must present checkboxes and sub-parameters, not SKU lists
- Business logic determines SKUs based on parameters
- SKU list is shown in Review step (not selection step)
- "Add SKU" and "Remove SKU" are secondary actions with warnings

### A.23 Why Configurable Rules Engine Instead of Hard-Coded Logic (v1.9)

**Decision:** The parameter-to-SKU and parameter-to-SaaS mapping logic is implemented as **configurable rules** in the database, not as hard-coded application logic.

**Rationale:**
- **Future flexibility:** New parameters can be added without code changes
- **SKU evolution:** As SKUs are added, renamed, or restructured, rules can be updated via Admin UI
- **Relationship changes:** If business decides Training Suite should no longer auto-include, or a new prerequisite is added, it's a configuration change
- **Testing and validation:** Rules can be tested in preview mode before activating
- **Audit trail:** Rule changes are logged, providing history of why SKU selection logic changed
- **Reduces deployment risk:** Business rule changes don't require code releases
- **Empowers business owners:** Product/sales leadership can adjust rules without developer involvement

**Types of configurable rules:**

| Rule Type | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Parameter Definition | Define what inputs are collected | "Number of Departments" (Number, required, min=1) |
| Parameter Visibility | Show/hide parameters conditionally | Show "Bank Name" only when ICL is enabled |
| Parameter-to-SKU | Map parameter values to SKU selection | Departments > 1 → Add "Enterprise Setup - Medium" |
| Parameter-to-SaaS | Map parameters to SaaS products | RevSub_Enabled = true → Add Revenue Submission SaaS |
| SKU Dependency | Define SKU prerequisites/bundles | Template Block requires Base |
| Integration Type | Map integration types to SKUs | Credit + Existing → Credit Integration - Existing SKU |

**Formula support:** Rules support quantity formulas, not just fixed values:
- `CEILING((Templates - 10) / 10)` for Template Blocks
- `Departments - 1` for Additional Department Setup
- `ProjectDuration` for PM Month quantity

**Extensibility examples:**
- Add a new "Check Validation" parameter with its own SKU mapping (future product)
- Add a new integration type (e.g., "API Gateway") with custom maturity levels
- Change Training Suite from "always included" to "included when project > 6 months"
- Add a new "Enterprise XL" organization tier with different criteria

**Trade-offs acknowledged:**
- **More complex initial build:** Rules engine is harder to build than hard-coded IF statements
- **Learning curve:** Admins need to understand rule configuration
- **Testing burden:** More combinations to test when rules change

**Mitigation:**
- Provide rule templates for common patterns
- Include preview/test mode to see rule evaluation results
- Document initial rule set as reference examples
- Validate rules for conflicts and circular dependencies

## Appendix B: Business Context

This appendix provides background information for developers unfamiliar with the Can/Am business.

### B.1 What Is Teller?

Teller is a point-of-sale (POS) and payment processing software solution designed for government and municipal organizations. It handles:
- In-person payment collection (utility bills, permits, taxes, fees)
- Online citizen payment portal
- Check scanning and Image Cash Letter (ICL) processing
- Integration with financial systems (ERP, utility billing, permitting)
- Revenue submission and reconciliation

### B.2 Who Are the Customers?

- **Primary:** Cities, counties, and municipal governments in the US and Canada
- **Size range:** Small towns (<10K population) to large cities (500K+ population)
- **Typical departments:** Finance/Treasury, Utilities, Building/Permitting, Parks & Recreation, Courts

### B.3 What Is a Reseller?

Can/Am works with implementation partners (resellers) who:
- Sell Teller as part of larger ERP implementations (e.g., Workday, Tyler)
- Bundle Teller with their own services
- May have existing relationships with government clients

**Reseller challenges (why this system exists):**
- Resellers struggled to quote Teller accurately
- Custom SOW negotiations were time-consuming
- Scope disputes arose from unclear boundaries
- Resellers wanted predictable, packaged offerings

### B.4 Current State (What This System Replaces)

- **Pricing Investment Template V11.xlsx** - Excel spreadsheet for calculations
- **Manual SOW creation** - Copy/paste from previous SOWs, heavy customization
- **Email-based iteration** - Multiple rounds of revisions via email
- **No version control** - Hard to track what changed between quote iterations

### B.5 Reference Implementation

The **City of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin** SOW is considered a representative example of a well-structured implementation:
- Total: $213,840 professional services
- 10-month project
- 8 integrations (mix of bi-directional and import)
- 3 departments
- Multiple modules (Check Recognition, ICL, Revenue Submission, Teller Online)

This SOW was used to validate SKU pricing and milestone structures.
