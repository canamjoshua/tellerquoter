### 1.2 Key Deliverables

1. **Teller Order Form** (Client-facing)
   - Combined SaaS + Setup Package pricing
   - For client signature

2. **Teller Implementation Plan / Exhibit C** (Client-facing)
   - Selected SKUs with scope descriptions
   - Deliverables per SKU
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Payment milestones (two styles supported)
   - Hardware options
   - Assumptions
   - Warranty terms

3. **Internal Quote Detail Document** (Internal)
   - All rates used
   - Parameters/inputs provided
   - Line-by-line detail including:
     - Escalation rates per line item
     - Discount impact per line
     - Referral fee impact (if applicable)
   - Supports Finance for billing/invoicing
   - Supports Quickbooks categorization
   - Supports Implementation team understanding of scope

4. **Quote Calculator/System**
   - Tool for building quotes
   - Generates all documents above

### 1.3 Quote Management

- Save/load quotes for review and editing
- Organize quotes by client/prospect name
- Search functionality to find quotes
- Auto-assigned quote number for tracking (e.g., Q-2025-0001)

### 1.4 Discounts

- **Types:** Percentage-based (primary) AND fixed dollar amount
- **Can apply to:**
  - SaaS First Year only
  - SaaS throughout (all years)
  - Setup Packages (Services)
  - Any combination of the above
- **Visibility:** Internal document shows impact per line item and on margins

### 1.5 Referral Fees

- Percentage of first year SaaS (typically 5% or 10%)
- Varies by referrer
- System stores referrer information (name, standard rate) for selection
- Shown on internal document / reseller communication only
- NOT shown on client-facing documents

### 1.6 Contract Document Hierarchy

The quoting system generates documents that fit into the existing Can/Am contract structure:

| Document | Purpose | Generated By System? |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| **Teller Order Form** | Master ordering document with SaaS + Setup Packages + Variable items | Yes |
| **Exhibit A** | Ad Hoc Professional Services hourly rate ($230/hr for post-go-live work) | Eliminated - content moved to Order Form |
| **Exhibit B** | SaaS Service Descriptions + Hardware Catalog | Template (static boilerplate) |
| **Exhibit C** | Teller Implementation Plan - Selected SKUs, deliverables, acceptance criteria, milestones | Yes |

### 1.7 System Evolution

The quoting system evolves from the existing **Pricing Investment Template V11.xlsx** spreadsheet:

- **Current state:** Excel-based pricing calculator with manual document creation
- **Target state:** Web-based quoting system with automated document generation
- **Migration:** Pricing logic, tier structures, and formulas extracted from V11.xlsx and built into new system
- **Output format:** Word documents (.docx) matching current templates

### 1.8 Configurability Principle

**IMPORTANT:** All prices, amounts, formulas, tier thresholds, and calculation logic specified in this document are **examples only**. The system must allow Admin users to configure all of these values through the Admin UI without code changes.

This includes but is not limited to:
- SKU prices and estimated hours
- SaaS product base prices
- Volume tier thresholds and prices
- Travel zone definitions and costs
- Per diem rates
- Escalation percentages
- Default percentages (initial payment, etc.)
- Population thresholds for Organization Setup tier suggestions
- Complexity thresholds for travel suggestions
- All text snippets (assumptions, warranty, etc.)

The numbers in this document represent the **initial configuration** based on current business rules. Business rules change; the system must accommodate this without developer intervention.

### 1.9 Quote & Pricing Versioning

#### 1.9.1 Quote Iterations

Quotes frequently go through multiple iterations during RFP response and contract negotiation. The system must support:

- **Quote Versioning:** Each quote can have multiple versions (v1, v2, v3...)
- **Version History:** All versions are preserved and accessible
- **Version Comparison:** Ability to see what changed between versions
- **Version Branching:** Create a new version from any previous version (not just the latest)
- **Version Naming:** Auto-increment (v1, v2, v3) plus optional user-provided description (e.g., "v2 - Removed 2 integrations per client request")

#### 1.9.2 Pricing Versions

Pricing configurations (SKU prices, SaaS tiers, formulas) must be versioned:

- **Pricing Version ID:** Each set of pricing rules has a unique version identifier
- **Effective Date:** When this pricing version became active
- **Expiration Date:** Optional; when this pricing version expires (null = no expiration)
- **Version Description:** Admin-provided description of changes (e.g., "2026 Q1 price increase")
- **Immutability:** Once a pricing version is used by any quote, it cannot be modified (only superseded by a new version)

#### 1.9.3 Quote-to-Pricing Linkage

Each quote version is permanently linked to a specific pricing version:

- **Initial Quote:** Uses the current active pricing version at time of creation
- **Quote Revision:** By default, continues using the same pricing version as the previous quote version
- **Pricing Override:** User can explicitly choose to upgrade a quote revision to a newer pricing version (with warning)
- **Expired Pricing Warning:** If the linked pricing version has expired, system warns user but still allows quote revision using original pricing (common for RFP responses where pricing is locked)
- **Forced Upgrade:** Admin can configure whether expired pricing blocks quote revision or just warns

#### 1.9.4 Pricing Version Contents

A pricing version includes all configurable values:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| SKU Pricing | All 26 SKU prices, hours, Quickbooks categories |
| SaaS Pricing | Base prices, tier thresholds, tier prices |
| Travel | Zone definitions, airfare by zone, per diem defaults |
| Calculations | Hourly rate, escalation percentages, default initial payment % |
| Thresholds | Population tiers, complexity thresholds |

#### 1.9.5 Audit Trail

All changes to pricing versions must be logged:

- Who created/modified
- When
- What changed (before/after values)
- Why (optional admin-provided reason)

---

## 2. SKU Data Model Requirements

The system must maintain a database of 26 Setup Package SKUs plus SaaS products, each with multiple attributes for pricing, document generation, and quoting logic.

| 2 | $100 |
| 5 | $200 |
| 10 | $300 |
| 15 | $400 |
| 25 | $500 |

### 3.3 Teller Payments

- **Not a SaaS cost** - No additional monthly fee
- **Enables 10% discount** off total SaaS cost when included
- **Assumption:** Teller Payments is used for all payment processing for Teller
- Shown as optional selection in quote builder

### 3.4 Annual Inflation / Escalation

Three escalation models are supported:

| Model | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Standard 4%** | 4% annual increase from Year 2 onwards | Default for most deals |
| **CPI-Based** | Tied to Consumer Price Index, minimum 0% | RFP requirements for CPI |
| **Multi-Year Freeze** | No escalation for Years 1-N, then 4% annually | Government/RFP with rate protection |

### 3.5 Multi-Year Projections

- **Projection period:** User selects (default: 5 years)
- System calculates year-by-year costs with escalation
- System calculates total over projection period

### 3.6 Level Loading Option

For clients requiring constant (non-escalated) annual costs:

- **Calculation:** Total escalated cost over projection period ÷ number of years = constant annual amount
- **Effect:** Each year's SaaS cost is the same flat amount
- **Revenue neutral:** Can/Am receives the same total revenue over the period
- **Display:** Level loading adjustment applied to Teller Standard/Basic line item in Order Form

**Example (5-year projection):**

| Year | Standard Escalated | Level Loaded |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1 | $35,400 | $38,254 |
| 2 | $36,816 | $38,254 |
| 3 | $38,289 | $38,254 |
| 4 | $39,820 | $38,254 |
| 5 | $41,413 | $38,254 |
| **Total** | **$191,738** | **$191,270** |

---

## 4. Travel Cost Calculation Requirements

Travel costs are calculated separately and shown in the Variable section of the Order Form.

### 4.1 Travel Zones

All zone and airfare values are configurable via Admin UI.

| Zone | Region | Airfare Estimate |
|------|--------|------------------|
| 0 | Denver Metro Colorado | $0 |
| 1 | Western US | $750 |
| 2 | Mid-Western US | $850 |
| 3 | Eastern US | $950 |
| 4 | Outside Continental US | $1,050 |
| 5 | Canada | $950 |

### 4.2 Travel Cost Components

Travel costs consist of four components. Per diem (meals) should be looked up against **GSA rates** for the client's location when available.

| Component | Default Rate | Basis | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|-------|
| Airfare | Per zone table above | Per person per trip | Varies by zone |
| Hotel | $180 | Per person per night | GSA lookup preferred |
| Per Diem (Meals) | $60 | Per person per day | GSA lookup preferred |
| Vehicle | $125 | Per day (shared) | Rental car or mileage, same for all zones |

**Notes:**
- Airfare is the only component that varies by zone
- Vehicle cost is per day for the trip (shared among travelers), not per person
- Hotel nights = trip days + 1 (arrive evening before, leave morning after)
- For Denver Metro zone, airfare is $0 but other costs still apply

**GSA Integration:** System should support lookup of GSA per diem rates by client city/state. If GSA lookup unavailable or not configured, use default rates.

### 4.3 Standard Trip Types

| Trip Type | Days | People | Typical Phase |
|-----------|------|--------|---------------|
| Kickoff & Analysis | 2 | 2 | Month 1 |
| Interface Integration | 2 | 1 | Month 2 |
| Training | 2 | 2 | Month 9 |
| Go-Live Support | 2 | 1 | Month 10 |

### 4.4 Complexity-Driven Trip Defaults

The system should suggest default trip configurations based on project complexity.

**Complexity Factor:** Derived from total annual SaaS value (which reflects overall implementation complexity including integrations, departments, modules, etc.)

| Complexity Level | Total Annual SaaS | Default Trips |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Low | < $50,000 | Kickoff only (or remote) |
| Medium | $50,000 - $100,000 | Kickoff + Go-Live |
| High | $100,000 - $150,000 | Kickoff + Training + Go-Live |
| Very High | > $150,000 | All 4 trip types |

*Note: These are suggestions only. Sales can override trip selections.*

### 4.5 Travel Cost Formula

```
Trip Nights = Days + 1 (arrive evening before, leave morning after)
Trip Cost = (Airfare × People) + (Hotel × People × Trip Nights) + (Per Diem × People × Trip Nights) + (Vehicle × Trip Nights)
Total Travel = Sum of all trip costs
```

**Example: 2-day trip with 2 people to Zone 1 (Western US)**
- Trip Nights: 2 + 1 = 3
- Airfare: $750 × 2 = $1,500
- Hotel: $180 × 2 people × 3 nights = $1,080
- Per Diem: $60 × 2 people × 3 nights = $360
- Vehicle: $125 × 3 nights = $375
- **Trip Total: $3,315**

### 4.6 Travel Time

- Travel TIME (labor hours) is built into SKU pricing
- Travel COSTS (expenses) are billed separately at estimated/actual cost

---

## 5. Implementation Plan Requirements

### 5.1 Payment Milestone Styles

The system supports two payment milestone styles:

#### Style A: Fixed Monthly

Simple, predictable payment schedule.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| InitialPaymentPercentage | Percentage due at contract execution | 25% |
| ProjectDurationMonths | Number of months for remaining payments | From quote |

**Calculation:**
- Initial Payment = Total Setup Packages × InitialPaymentPercentage
- Monthly Payment = (Total Setup Packages - Initial Payment) ÷ (ProjectDurationMonths - 1)
- PM services included in monthly amount

**Example (10-month project, $100,000, 25% initial):**
- Contract Execution: $25,000 (25%)
- Months 2-10: $8,333.33 each (9 payments)
- Total: $100,000

#### Style B: Deliverable-Based

Payments tied to specific deliverable acceptance points.

**Components:**
1. Initial payment at contract execution (percentage of total)
2. Monthly services fee (PM + prorated deliverables)
3. Major deliverable payments tied to SKU completion

**Monthly Services Calculation:**
- PM SKU total ÷ ProjectDurationMonths = Monthly PM portion
- 50% of other SKUs ÷ ProjectDurationMonths = Prorated deliverable portion
- Monthly Services = PM portion + Prorated portion

**Deliverable Payments:**
- Remaining 50% of non-PM SKUs paid at acceptance milestones
- Each SKU has DeliveryMilestones with TypicalMonth and PercentageOfSKU

**Example (10-month project, $186,750 total, 15% initial):**
- Contract Execution: $28,013 (15%)
- Monthly Services (×10): $6,000 each
- Enterprise Setup Complete (Month 2): $10,250
- Integration Requirements (Month 3): $25,750
- Integration Development (Month 6): $34,500
- Modules Complete (Month 7): $18,500
- Training Complete (Month 9): $14,000
- Go-Live (Month 10): $16,000

### 5.4 Assumptions

#### Standard Assumptions (Always Included)

1. All deliverables are provided on a Fixed Price basis.
2. [X]% of services are billed upon contract signing.
3. No data conversion of cashiering data is anticipated in this project or included in the scope.
4. Usage training is on a "train the trainer" basis, designed to enable the Client's key users to train existing and future staff on Teller.
5. Statement of Work is based on the assumption of a single Teller implementation cycle.
6. Travel and accommodation costs will be billed based on actual travel costs per the Can/Am Travel Policy.

#### Conditional Assumptions (Based on Quote Components)

| Trigger | Assumption Text |
|---------|-----------------|
| Bi-Directional Integrations | Bi-Directional interfaces scoped within Interface Configuration Activities assume the usage of pre-existing Teller integration capabilities with the specified systems/solutions. Any new functionality requests/requirements will be evaluated and may constitute additions to scope. |
| Bi-Directional Integrations | For all business application interfaces, the Client will facilitate and/or provide the Teller implementation team with all API specifications and/or database connection details and/or example files as well as a dev/test environment suitable for development of the interfaces. |
| Teller Online | Online Payment functionality assumes that Client will contract with [Payment Vendor] for electronic payment processing and online bill payment. |
| Teller Payments | Credit Processing assumes that Client will contract with CORE for electronic payment processing. |
| Image Cash Letter | Image Cash Letter integration is based on an interface to [Bank Name] and assumes that the Bank will cooperate in testing and approval for ICL submission from Client's Teller system. |
| Check Recognition | Client will acquire and set up all POS hardware and Credit Terminals (through CanAm if desired). |

### 5.5 Warranty

## Appendix A: Design Decisions & Rationale

This appendix documents key decisions and the reasoning behind them, to help future developers/maintainers understand the "why" behind the system design.

### A.1 Why Productized SKUs Instead of Custom SOWs

**Decision:** Transform professional services into standardized Setup Package SKUs with fixed pricing.

**Rationale:**
- **Reseller friction:** Custom SOWs required extensive back-and-forth with resellers to define scope, leading to delays and disputes
- **Quoting speed:** Custom scoping took hours/days; target is 15 minutes with SKU selection
- **Scalability:** Can/Am cannot scale beyond current team if every deal requires custom scoping
- **Scope creep prevention:** Fixed SKU boundaries make it clear what's included vs. out-of-scope
- **Quality consistency:** Same SKU = same delivery process = predictable outcomes
- **Future certification:** Enables training third parties to deliver standardized packages

**Source:** Impact Filter document (project vision statement)

### A.2 Why Two Payment Milestone Styles

**Decision:** Support both Fixed Monthly and Deliverable-Based milestone schedules.

**Rationale:**
- **Fixed Monthly:** Some clients (especially government) need predictable monthly budget allocations; simpler for Finance to manage
- **Deliverable-Based:** Other clients prefer paying tied to acceptance of specific deliverables; provides accountability checkpoints
- **Negotiation flexibility:** Can switch styles during contract negotiation without re-quoting
- **Historical precedent:** Fond du Lac SOW used deliverable-based; other clients have requested fixed monthly

**Trade-off:** Deliverable-Based requires more complex calculation and SKU-level milestone data; Fixed Monthly is simpler but less granular.

### A.3 Why Integration Pricing Has 3.9x Difference (Configuration vs Custom)

**Decision:** Integration - Configuration ($7,360) vs Integration - Custom Development ($28,520)

**Rationale:**
- **Actual effort difference:** Configuration uses pre-built connectors (32 hrs); Custom requires new development (124 hrs)
- **Risk profile:** Custom development has higher uncertainty and testing requirements
- **Mature Integrations List:** Critical for accurate quoting - sales MUST verify if an integration is "mature" (2-3+ clients already using) before quoting Configuration price
- **Mis-quoting impact:** Quoting Configuration for what should be Custom = $21,160 revenue loss and delivery problems

**Implication for system:** Must enforce selection from Mature Integrations List when Configuration SKU is chosen; warn if integration not on list.

### A.4 Why Travel Costs Are Separate from SKU Pricing

**Decision:** Travel TIME (labor) is built into SKUs; Travel COSTS (expenses) are calculated separately and shown in Variable section.

**Rationale:**
- **Geographic variability:** Airfare, hotels, per diem vary significantly by client location
- **GSA compliance:** Government clients often require GSA rate adherence
- **Transparency:** Clients can see travel as a distinct line item
- **Actual cost billing:** Travel is billed at actual cost, not estimated; showing estimate sets expectations
- **Denver Metro exception:** Can/Am is based in Colorado; no airfare needed for local clients

**Zone system rationale:** Simplified into 6 zones to make quoting fast while maintaining reasonable accuracy.

### A.5 Why Exhibit A Was Eliminated

**Decision:** Move Ad Hoc Professional Services hourly rate from Exhibit A into Order Form body.

**Rationale:**
- **Document simplification:** Fewer exhibits = simpler contract structure
- **Exhibit A was minimal:** Only contained one item (hourly rate) - didn't warrant separate exhibit
- **Exhibit B retained:** SaaS Service Descriptions are substantial and static (boilerplate)
- **Exhibit C retained:** Implementation Plan is dynamic and deal-specific

### A.6 Why Internal Quote Detail Document Exists

**Decision:** Generate a separate internal-only document with full pricing detail.

**Rationale:**
- **Finance needs:** Billing/invoicing requires line-by-line detail not appropriate for client documents
- **Quickbooks integration:** Category codes needed for proper accounting
- **Referral fee visibility:** Reseller fees shown internally, never on client documents
- **Discount transparency:** Impact of discounts on margins visible to sales management
- **Implementation handoff:** Delivery team needs to understand what was sold (hours, scope per SKU)

### A.7 Why Pricing Versioning Is Required

**Decision:** All pricing configurations are versioned; quotes are linked to specific pricing versions.

**Rationale:**
- **RFP integrity:** During RFP responses, pricing is often "locked" - revisions to a quote must use original pricing even if Can/Am's standard pricing has changed
- **Audit trail:** Finance and management need to understand what pricing was in effect when a quote was created
- **Immutability:** Once pricing is used in a quote, it cannot be changed (only superseded by new version)
- **Reproduction:** Must be able to regenerate documents with exact pricing from any point in time

**Trade-off:** More complex data model, but essential for business integrity.

### A.8 Why Quote Versioning Is Required

**Decision:** Quotes support multiple versions (v1, v2, v3...) with full history preserved.

**Rationale:**
- **Negotiation reality:** Quotes go through multiple iterations during client discussions
- **Change tracking:** Sales and management need to see what changed between versions
- **Rollback capability:** Sometimes need to revert to a previous version
- **Audit compliance:** Some contracts require showing negotiation history

### A.9 Why Check Recognition & ICL Are Bundled

**Decision:** Single SKU "Check Recognition & ICL Setup" rather than separate SKUs.

**Rationale:**
- **Mirrors SaaS bundling:** SaaS pricing bundles these together
- **Technical dependency:** ICL requires Check Recognition to function
- **Typical purchase pattern:** Clients buying check scanning almost always need ICL
- **Pricing simplicity:** One SKU to configure vs. two

### A.10 Why Organization Setup Includes Go-Live Support

**Decision:** Go-Live support (2 days) is bundled into Organization Setup SKUs, not a separate SKU.

**Rationale:**
- **Every implementation needs Go-Live:** Never makes sense to skip; bundling ensures it's included
- **Pricing clarity:** Client sees one price for "getting started" rather than multiple line items
- **Tier differentiation:** Single Dept (16 hrs Go-Live), Enterprise Mid (16 hrs), Enterprise Large (24 hrs) - reflects complexity
- **Prevents underselling:** Sales can't accidentally omit Go-Live support

### A.11 Why Level Loading Option Exists

**Decision:** Allow SaaS pricing to be "level loaded" (constant annual amount) instead of escalating.

**Rationale:**
- **Government budgeting:** Many government clients need predictable year-over-year costs for budget planning
- **Revenue neutral:** Can/Am receives same total revenue; just distributed differently
- **RFP requirements:** Some RFPs explicitly require flat pricing over contract term
- **Calculation method:** Sum of escalated costs ÷ years = level loaded annual amount

### A.12 Why Three Escalation Models

**Decision:** Support Standard 4%, CPI-Based, and Multi-Year Freeze escalation options.

**Rationale:**
- **Standard 4%:** Default for most commercial clients; predictable increase
- **CPI-Based:** Some RFPs require CPI-linked pricing; protects both parties from inflation
- **Multi-Year Freeze:** Government RFPs sometimes require rate protection for 3-5 years; compensated by higher initial pricing or accepted as competitive positioning

### A.13 Why Conditional Assumptions

**Decision:** Assumptions section includes both standard (always shown) and conditional (shown based on quote components) assumptions.

**Rationale:**
- **Reduces manual editing:** System automatically includes relevant caveats based on what's quoted
- **Prevents omissions:** Critical assumptions (e.g., "Client provides API specs") not forgotten
- **Document consistency:** Same triggers = same assumptions across all quotes
- **Examples:**
  - Bi-directional integrations → Include API/dev environment assumption
  - Teller Payments → Include CORE merchant agreement assumption
  - ICL → Include bank cooperation assumption

### A.14 Why Training Is Train-the-Trainer

**Decision:** Standard training SKUs are Train-the-Trainer format (24 hrs, $5,520); End-User sessions are separate (4 hrs, $920).

**Rationale:**
- **Scalability:** Training 2-3 trainers who then train hundreds of users is more efficient than Can/Am training everyone
- **Client empowerment:** Client staff become self-sufficient for onboarding new employees
- **Cost efficiency:** Lower total cost for client vs. paying for all end-user training
- **Exception available:** End-User Cashiering Training SKU exists for clients who prefer direct training

### A.15 Why 15-Minute Quoting Target

**Decision:** Sales should be able to complete a quote in under 15 minutes.

**Rationale:**
- **Current pain point:** Manual process takes hours, sometimes days for complex quotes
- **Reseller responsiveness:** Resellers need quick turnaround to respond to their clients
- **Volume handling:** As sales grow, can't spend hours per quote
- **Competitive advantage:** Faster quotes = better win rate

**Implication for system:** Minimize clicks, auto-suggest based on SaaS selections, pre-fill defaults, show running totals in real-time.

### A.16 Why Population-Based Organization Setup Tiers

**Decision:** Enterprise Setup tiers based on population (<100K = Mid-tier, 100K+ = Large).

**Rationale:**
- **Proxy for complexity:** Population correlates with number of departments, transaction volume, integration complexity
- **Easy to determine:** Population is publicly available data; doesn't require discovery call
- **Historical validation:** Effort estimates validated against projects of different sizes
- **Not perfect but practical:** Some small cities are complex, some large cities are simple - but population is a reasonable default that sales can override

### A.17 Why All Configuration Must Be Admin-Editable

**Decision:** Every price, formula, threshold, and text snippet must be configurable via Admin UI without code changes.

**Rationale:**
- **Business agility:** Pricing changes shouldn't require developer involvement
- **Reduced risk:** No code deployments for business rule changes
- **Empowerment:** Business owners can respond quickly to market conditions
- **Audit trail:** All changes logged with who/when/why

**Examples of configurable items:**
- SKU prices and hours
- Hourly rate ($230 currently)
- SaaS tier thresholds and prices
- Escalation percentages
- Travel zone costs
- Population thresholds for tier suggestions
- All document text (warranty, assumptions, etc.)

## Appendix B: Business Context

This appendix provides background information for developers unfamiliar with the Can/Am business.

### B.1 What Is Teller?

Teller is a point-of-sale (POS) and payment processing software solution designed for government and municipal organizations. It handles:
- In-person payment collection (utility bills, permits, taxes, fees)
- Online citizen payment portal
- Check scanning and Image Cash Letter (ICL) processing
- Integration with financial systems (ERP, utility billing, permitting)
- Revenue submission and reconciliation

### B.2 Who Are the Customers?

- **Primary:** Cities, counties, and municipal governments in the US and Canada
- **Size range:** Small towns (<10K population) to large cities (500K+ population)
- **Typical departments:** Finance/Treasury, Utilities, Building/Permitting, Parks & Recreation, Courts

### B.3 What Is a Reseller?

Can/Am works with implementation partners (resellers) who:
- Sell Teller as part of larger ERP implementations (e.g., Workday, Tyler)
- Bundle Teller with their own services
- May have existing relationships with government clients

**Reseller challenges (why this system exists):**
- Resellers struggled to quote Teller accurately
- Custom SOW negotiations were time-consuming
- Scope disputes arose from unclear boundaries
- Resellers wanted predictable, packaged offerings

### B.4 Current State (What This System Replaces)

- **Pricing Investment Template V11.xlsx** - Excel spreadsheet for calculations
- **Manual SOW creation** - Copy/paste from previous SOWs, heavy customization
- **Email-based iteration** - Multiple rounds of revisions via email
- **No version control** - Hard to track what changed between quote iterations

### B.5 Reference Implementation

The **City of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin** SOW is considered a representative example of a well-structured implementation:
- Total: $213,840 professional services
- 10-month project
- 8 integrations (mix of bi-directional and import)
- 3 departments
- Multiple modules (Check Recognition, ICL, Revenue Submission, Teller Online)

This SOW was used to validate SKU pricing and milestone structures.
